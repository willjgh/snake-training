# snake-training
Testing genetic algorithms to learn snake

## Todo

- (Evolution)(Snake) Better fitness function, perhaps updated during game with moves used per food
- (Evolution) Test different crossover methods, try returning two children per binary crossover

- (Snake)(Model) Test different inputs, try one hot encodings rather than distances, or reciprocal distances

- (Population)(MultiDisplay) method to display all models of population
- (Display) draw snake grey when dead, but avoid repeatedly drawing once dead?
